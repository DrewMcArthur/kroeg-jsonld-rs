# jsonld-rs

This is a (WIP, partially implemented) JSON-LD API implementation. It also includes a small (also WIP)
 helper library that takes expanded JSON-LD and turns it into a separate structure that is easier
 to process (and also reversible into expanded JSON-LD, of course).

TODO:
- [ ] Flattening
- [ ] JSON-LD to RDF
- [ ] RDF to JSON-LD
- [ ] A more useful helper thing
